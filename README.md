## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the Mod up and running. See "Known Issues" notes for known Issues with certain mods.


## Installing Skyrim & Mods

1. Install Skyrim SE to C:\Games\Skyrim - Skyrim - Special Edition (ie SkyrimSE.exe should be C:\Games\Skyrim - Skyrim\SkyrimSE.exe)

2. Make sure you on latest patch Version 1.5.39. This is a HARD requirement or some Mods will not work! You can check your Patch Version while paused in game. SKSE is already provided by the mod.

3. Extract the Archive to  C:\Games\Skyrim - Skyrim - Special Edition and say "Yes" when asked to overwrite. If not prompted to overwrite you did NOT extract to the right location.


## Getting Mods Ready

### Note: C:\Games\Skyrim - Skyrim - Special Edition will now be shortened as "root"
 
1. Run BethINI.exe located in root\BethINI-4875-2-7\BethINI\BethINI.exe. ***N2S fix this dumbass structure in next alpha***

2. Go to Setup Tab and change the Game Path. Select SkyrimSELauncher. ***I forgot to fix this before packing the mod. Will fix next Alpha.***

3. Go to Basic Tab. Select your Resolution. Note I haven't tested 1440p & above. 

4. Presets: Laptops I recommend Meduim or High. Start with high then drop if FPS suffers. Desktops pick High/Ultra.

6. Run Mod Orgamizer.exe in root\Mod Mod Organizer 2\ModOrganizer.exe

7. Make sure the Modded Profile is selected and all 124 Mods are checked.
