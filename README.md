## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the Mod up and running. See "Known Issues" notes for known Issues with certain mods.


## Installing Skyrim & Mods
After you have downloaded the Modpack please follow the instructions below. For simplicity's sake, these instructions were created under the impression that Skyrim was installed on the X drive (X:\Skyrim - Special Edition). This allows you to just extract the modpack rather than reconfigure your ini's.

•Normal non-steam installation is recommended for maximum compatibility, no problems / no user error
•My Mod Pack includes SKSE64. Do NOT Install SKSE64 Yourself. If you did then remove it!

1: Create a new drive/partition with the assigned letter "X" or SSD users can simply assign a drive the letter X:\
*Drive Requirement: 60GB or 61440MB
*New folder path should be X:\Skyrim - Special Edition, if folder paths is not exactly "X:\Skyrim - Special Edition" pack will not function properly!

2. Make sure you on latest patch Version 1.5.39. This is a HARD requirement or some Mods will not work! You can check your Patch Version while paused in game. SKSE is already provided by the mod.

3. Copy/extract the contents of the pack to X:\Skyrim - Special Edition (use 7zip for error free operation)n and say "Yes" when asked to overwrite. 

*If not prompted to overwrite you did NOT extract to the right location.


## Getting Mods Ready

### Note: X:Skyrim - Special Edition will now be shortened as "root"
 
1. Run BethINI.exe located in root\BethINI\BethINI.exe.

2. Go to Setup Tab and make sure all Paths point to the right folders/executables in X:\Skyrim - Special Edition.

3. Go to Basic Tab. Select your Resolution. Note I haven't tested 1440p & above. 

4. Presets: Laptops I recommend Meduim or High. Start with high then drop if FPS suffers. Desktops pick High/Ultra.

5. Select Recommend Tweaks. Save and Exit.

6. Run Mod Orgamizer.exe in root\Mod Mod Organizer 2\ModOrganizer.exe

7. Make sure the Modded Profile is selected and all 124 Mods are checked.

8. Do NOT sort your Mods using LOOT or Mod Organizer!!!! I have presorted them!

9. In MO Select Skyrim Launcher in MO. Turn off "Snow Shaders" in the Skyrim Launcher Advanced Settings. Close the Launcher.

10. In MO Select the Diamond at the top or Click on the drop down and select SKSE and click Run.

## Known Issues

Lanterns Mod does not run. Error about Readonly directory.

Shadow/Lighting Issues? Particually for Campfires.

Rocks are shiny at night. This is caused by the Vivid Weathers Mod. To Fix turn off "Snow Shaders" in the Skyrim Launcher Advanced Settings
